# Archive Directory (_old)

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used in the project but are kept for reference.

## Structure

- **documents/** - PDF documents (research papers, dataset documentation)
- **legacy_scripts/** - Old Python scripts that are no longer used
- **web_artifacts/** - HTML/JS files from web downloads (dataset pages, etc.)
- **documentation_old/** - Old documentation files (replaced by newer versions)
- **old_results/** - Previous results directory (now using `output/`)

## Notes

- These files are kept for historical reference
- Main project now uses: `main.py`, `main_pipeline.py`, and `output/` directory
- Documentation has been consolidated into: `README.md`, `DIMENSIONS_CALCULATION.md`, `OUTPUT_EXPECTED.md`
