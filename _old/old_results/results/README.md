# Results Directory Structure

This directory contains all generated output files (PNG images) organized by algorithm type.

## File Generation

- **data_analysis/** - Generated by `data_training.py` during data exploration phase
- **machine_learning/** - Generated by `data_training.py` after model training
- **reinforcement_learning/** - Generated by `RL_training.py` after RL training
- **documentation/** - Manual additions or from other scripts

## Organization Script

To organize PNG files automatically, run:
```bash
python organize_png.py
```

This script will:
- Move all PNG files from root directory to appropriate subdirectories
- Create directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Preserve existing files in their correct locations

## Note

The scripts automatically create these directories when saving PNG files. No manual organization needed for new files generated by the training scripts.
